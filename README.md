- **Attendance Marking**: Easily record **Check-In** and **Check-Out** times using intuitive buttons.
- **Employee Database Integration**: Stores attendance data in a PostgreSQL database for easy access and report generation.
- **Tkinter User Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for better user experience.
- **Working Hours Calculation**: Automatically computes daily working hours and updates the records.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, `face_recognition`, Tkinter
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Image Handling**: PIL (Pillow)

## üöÄ How It Works
1. **Employee Data Management**: Fetch employee details, including facial images, from the PostgreSQL database.
2. **Face Recognition**: Use a webcam to capture and recognize employees in real-time.
